        <h1>Part 2: Business and Society (Weeks 3-7)</h1>

        <h2>Key Learning Objectives</h2>
        <p>Upon completing this part, students will be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze the relationship between business and society, including corporate social responsibility (CSR).</li>
            <li>Evaluate the moral justifications of capitalism and its impact on society.</li>
            <li>Understand the ethical dimensions of globalization and the role of multinational corporations (MNCs).</li>
            <li>Critically assess the concepts of social legitimacy, reputation management, and social and environmental disclosure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Main Topics</h2>

        <h3>Capitalism and Its Moral Justifications</h3>
        <p>Capitalism is an economic system characterized by private property, profit motive, competition, and limited government intervention. The moral justifications of capitalism include the natural right to property and Adam Smith’s 'invisible hand' theory, which suggests that individuals' pursuit of self-interest leads to the greatest good for all.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-term">Natural Right to Property:</span> Each individual has a natural right to own property.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Adam Smith’s ‘Invisible Hand’:</span> The greatest good for all is achieved through self-interest and competition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rival Views of Corporate Responsibility</h3>
        <p>Corporate responsibility can be viewed from two perspectives: the narrow view and the broad view.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-term">Narrow View:</span> Business has no social responsibilities other than to maximize profits for shareholders. This perspective, advocated by Milton Friedman, argues that the primary duty of management is to protect shareholder interests.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Broad View:</span> Companies have broader responsibilities to consumers, employees, suppliers, the community, and society at large. This perspective emphasizes the stakeholder model, where companies respond to those with whom they have significant relationships.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)</h3>
        <p>CSR involves businesses taking responsibility for their impact on society and the environment, going beyond profit maximization to include social and environmental concerns. Key components of CSR include ethical business practices, stakeholder engagement, and sustainability initiatives.</p>

        <h3>Globalization and Multinational Corporations (MNCs)</h3>
        <p>Globalization has led to the expansion of multinational corporations, which operate across multiple countries. While globalization brings benefits such as capital, technology, expertise, and improved standards of living, it also raises ethical concerns, particularly in developing countries.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-term">Benefits:</span> Capital, technology, expertise, skills and knowledge, and improved standards of living.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Disadvantages:</span> Power imbalance, potential for exploitation, lack of standards for working conditions, wages, and minimum working age.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Social Legitimacy and Reputation Management</h3>
        <p>Social legitimacy refers to the acceptance and approval of an organization by society, achieved by aligning organizational values and practices with societal norms and expectations. Reputation management involves actions taken by an organization to influence and control stakeholder perception, protecting and enhancing the organization’s image and brand.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-term">Social Legitimacy:</span> Acceptance and approval of an organization by society.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Reputation Management:</span> Actions taken to influence stakeholder perception and enhance the organization's image.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Social and Environmental Disclosure</h3>
        <p>Social and environmental disclosure involves providing information about an organization’s social and environmental impact, policies, and practices. This transparency demonstrates the organization’s commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability.</p>

        <h2>Critical Theories and Frameworks</h2>
        <p>The study of business and society involves various critical theories and frameworks that provide different perspectives on corporate responsibility and ethical practices. These include:</p>

        <h3>Milton Friedman’s Perspective</h3>
        <p>Milton Friedman argued that the sole responsibility of business is to maximize profits for shareholders, as long as it operates within the rules of the game. According to Friedman, corporate executives have a fiduciary duty to the owners of the business and should not pursue social responsibilities beyond profit maximization.</p>

        <h3>Stakeholder Theory</h3>
        <p>Stakeholder theory, developed by R. Edward Freeman, posits that businesses should create value for all stakeholders, not just shareholders. This includes customers, employees, suppliers, communities, and the environment. The theory emphasizes the interconnectedness of stakeholders and the need for businesses to consider the impact of their actions on all stakeholders.</p>

        <h3>Triple Bottom Line</h3>
        <p>The Triple Bottom Line framework, introduced by John Elkington, encourages businesses to focus on three key areas: people, planet, and profit. This approach emphasizes that businesses should strive for economic, social, and environmental sustainability, balancing profit-making with social and environmental responsibilities.</p>
