        <h3>The Tension Between Accounting, Accountability, and Social Expectations</h3>
        <p>Corporations often face a significant tension between the need to report accurate financial performance and the societal expectations for sustainable and moral behavior. This tension arises from the pressure to achieve financial growth while maintaining accountability and meeting social and environmental responsibilities.</p>
        <p>Companies are required to balance these competing demands through transparent accounting practices, robust accountability mechanisms, and a commitment to ethical and sustainable business practices.</p>

        <h3>Control: Risk Management</h3>

        <h2>Case Study: Westpac - The Bank that Broke the Bank</h2>
        <div class="case-study">
            <h3>Case Study: Westpac - The Bank that Broke the Bank</h3>
            <p>Westpac Banking Corporation, one of Australia's largest banks, faced significant challenges in the early 1990s due to poor risk management and excessive risk-taking. The bank's aggressive expansion and acquisition strategies led to substantial financial losses, forcing it to undergo a major restructuring.</p>
            <p>The case highlights the importance of effective risk management and corporate governance in maintaining the stability and sustainability of financial institutions. Key lessons from the Westpac case include the need for strong internal controls, transparent reporting, and a culture of ethical behavior and accountability.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Homework Questions and Detailed Answers</h2>

        <h3>1. Discuss the impact of aggressive growth strategies on risk exposure in organizations, as illustrated in the Westpac case.</h3>
        <p>Aggressive growth strategies can significantly increase an organization's risk exposure. In the Westpac case, the bank's rapid expansion and acquisitions led to overextended resources and inadequate risk controls. This resulted in substantial financial losses and a need for major restructuring. The impact of aggressive growth strategies includes heightened internal and external risks, increased pressure on management and employees, and potential erosion of social legitimacy if ethical standards are compromised in the pursuit of growth.</p>

        <h3>2. How can the COSO ERM framework help organizations manage the tension between growth and accountability?</h3>
        <p>The COSO ERM framework provides a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and managing risks. By integrating risk management into all levels of the organization, from governance and culture to performance and communication, the framework helps organizations balance growth with accountability. Key elements such as defining risk appetite, setting strategic objectives, and establishing strong control environments ensure that growth initiatives are pursued responsibly and sustainably.</p>

        <h3>3. Analyze the role of corporate governance in mitigating risks and enhancing social legitimacy, with reference to the Westpac case.</h3>
        <p>Corporate governance plays a crucial role in mitigating risks and enhancing social legitimacy. In the Westpac case, the lack of effective governance and oversight contributed to the bank's financial difficulties. Strong corporate governance involves clear accountability structures, transparency in reporting, and a commitment to ethical behavior. By ensuring that management decisions align with the interests of shareholders and stakeholders, corporate governance frameworks help maintain trust and legitimacy in the eyes of the public.</p>
