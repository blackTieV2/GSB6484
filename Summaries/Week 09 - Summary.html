        <h2>Main Topics</h2>

        <h3>Corporate Culture</h3>
        <p>Corporate culture encompasses the beliefs, values, and behaviors unique to each corporation. It sets a pattern for corporate activities and actions, influencing how employees interact and make decisions. A strong corporate culture aligns with the company's goals and helps adapt to changes, while a weak culture may have fragmented values and inconsistent behaviors.</p>
        <p>Visible elements of corporate culture include language, technology, clothing, manner of address, myths, stories, organizational charts, structural processes, and rituals. Invisible elements consist of espoused beliefs and values that guide employees' actions and the underlying assumptions shaping their perceptions and behaviors.</p>

        <h3>Ethical Culture</h3>
        <p>Ethical culture refers to the organizational capacity and conditions that encourage ethical behaviors among employees. It is influenced by various dimensions, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-term">Role modeling:</span> Leaders and supervisors demonstrating ethical behavior.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Reinforcement:</span> Rewards and punishments for ethical and unethical behaviors.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Openness:</span> Encouraging discussions about ethical issues.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Commitment:</span> Employees' dedication to ethical conduct.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ethical Leadership</h3>
        <p>Ethical leadership involves influencing followers to behave ethically through role modeling, communication, and decision-making. An ethical leader is perceived as having integrity, honesty, and a commitment to ethical standards. They create a culture where ethical behavior is valued and expected.</p>
        <p>Key qualities of an ethical leader include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-term">Integrity:</span> Consistently expressing clear values through actions.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Courage:</span> Standing by ethical principles even in challenging situations.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Transparency:</span> Being open and honest with stakeholders.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Inclusiveness:</span> Building trust and transparency through involvement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Case Study: Grenda Corporation</h3>
        <div class="case-study">
            <h3>Case Study: Grenda Corporation</h3>
            <p>In early 2012, the family-owned Grenda Corporation sold its transport and manufacturing businesses after 66 years of ownership. The family patriarch, Ken Grenda, and his two sons shared the proceeds of the sale with their employees, distributing around A$15M among 1750 workers. This act of generosity was an extension of Ken Grenda's ethical business practices, which emphasized treating employees like family and acting with integrity and honesty.</p>
            <p>Ken Grenda's leadership approach, based on respect, trust, and care for employees, created a loyal workforce and a positive corporate culture. His ethical philosophy, influenced by deontology and justice ethics, prioritized the rights and dignity of all individuals within the company.</p>

        <h2>Homework Questions and Detailed Answers</h2>

        <h3>1. Why is it important for leaders to be not only ethical but to be perceived as being ethical?</h3>
        <p>Leaders must be perceived as ethical because perception influences followers' trust and willingness to adhere to ethical standards. If employees believe their leaders are ethical, they are more likely to emulate their behavior and uphold the organization's values. Perception of ethical leadership builds credibility, fosters a positive corporate culture, and enhances the organization's reputation.</p>

        <h3>2. What would examples of authentic or artificial leadership look like, and what do you think would be the likely impact on ethical leadership?</h3>
        <p>Authentic leadership involves consistent actions aligned with the leader's true values and beliefs, fostering trust and respect. Examples include leaders who openly communicate their principles, demonstrate transparency, and engage with employees honestly. Artificial leadership, on the other hand, involves inconsistent or insincere actions aimed at portraying a false image. This can lead to mistrust, decreased morale, and a lack of commitment to ethical standards.</p>

        <h3>3. How would you explain the difference between the concepts of 'ethical leadership' and 'moral management'? Discuss examples of each and assess the impact on the overall ethical context of an organization with which you are familiar.</h3>
        <p><span class="important-term">Ethical leadership</span> focuses on influencing followers to behave ethically through role modeling, communication, and decision-making. An ethical leader demonstrates and promotes ethical conduct, creating a culture of integrity. For example, a CEO who regularly communicates the importance of ethical behavior and rewards ethical decisions exemplifies ethical leadership.</p>
        <p><span class="important-term">Moral management</span> involves implementing systems, policies, and practices to ensure ethical behavior within the organization. It includes setting ethical standards, monitoring compliance, and addressing unethical behavior. For instance, an organization that establishes a comprehensive code of ethics, provides ethics training, and enforces disciplinary measures for violations practices moral management.</p>
        <p>The impact of ethical leadership and moral management on an organization's ethical context is significant. Ethical leadership fosters a positive culture where employees feel valued and motivated to act ethically. Moral management ensures that ethical behavior is institutionalized and consistently upheld. Together, they create a robust ethical framework that enhances the organization's reputation and long-term success.</p>

        <h2>Activities and Homework Solutions</h2>
        <p>Week 9 activities involve discussions and exercises that help students apply the concepts learned in the lecture.
