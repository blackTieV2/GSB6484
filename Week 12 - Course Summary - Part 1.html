        <h1>Part 1: The Philosophy and Theories of Ethics (Weeks 1-2)</h1>

        <h2>Key Learning Objectives</h2>
        <p>Upon completing this part, students will be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand various philosophical and ethical theories relevant to business ethics.</li>
            <li>Analyze the ethical dimensions of individual character and moral rules that govern conduct.</li>
            <li>Critically evaluate different ethical theories and their application in business contexts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Main Topics</h2>

        <h3>Ethics Overview</h3>
        <p>Ethics deals with individual character, moral rules that govern our conduct, and questions of right and wrong, fairness and unfairness, good and bad, duty and obligation, justice and injustice, and the values and principles that should guide us.</p>

        <h3>Professional Qualities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-term">Honesty:</span> Important because society places trust in professionals to act in the public interest. Truth-telling is imperative, e.g., accurate financial statements are crucial for investor decisions.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Integrity:</span> Essential as we rely on professionals’ specialized knowledge and their acting in the public interest.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Professional Capability:</span> Professionals should ensure they are capable and keep abreast of new knowledge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Understanding Morality</h3>
        <p>Moral standards come from our upbringing, behavior of those around us, our culture, and our experiences. They differ from etiquette, law, and professional codes of ethics. Critical reflection is necessary to determine if our principles can withstand scrutiny.</p>

        <h3>Ethical Theories</h3>
        <p>Ethical theories are attempts to answer the central ethical question of how we should live our lives in a manner that promotes harmony. They offer frameworks for understanding and resolving ethical dilemmas in both personal and professional contexts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-term">Non-consequentialist Theories:</span> These focus on duties and principles. Examples include:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="important-term">Virtue Theory:</span> Emphasizes character and virtues such as honesty, courage, and compassion.</li>
                    <li><span class="important-term">Ethic of Care:</span> Focuses on the importance of interpersonal relationships and care for others.</li>
                    <li><span class="important-term">Kantian Ethics:</span> Based on the principle that actions are morally right if they can be universally applied and respect the autonomy of individuals.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Consequentialist Theories:</span> These focus on the outcomes of actions. Examples include:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="important-term">Egoism:</span> Suggests that actions are morally right if they promote the individual's best interests.</li>
                    <li><span class="important-term">Utilitarianism:</span> Proposes that actions are right if they lead to the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Critical Theories and Frameworks</h2>
        <p>The study of ethics involves various critical theories and frameworks that provide different perspectives on moral issues. These include:</p>

        <h3>Kohlberg’s Three Levels of Moral Development</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-term">Pre-conventional Level:</span> Morality is externally controlled. Individuals obey rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.</            <li><span class="important-term">Conventional Level:</span> Individuals conform to social norms and expectations to maintain order and gain approval.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Post-conventional Level:</span> Morality is based on abstract principles and the recognition of universal ethical principles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Longstaff’s Three Views of Human Nature</h3>
        <p>Longstaff describes three perspectives on human nature that influence ethical behavior and management approaches:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-term">Machiavellian:</span> Assumes people are selfish and deceitful, requiring strict controls and enforcement to ensure compliance.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Robespierrean:</span> Believes most people are good, but a few "rotten apples" must be rigorously checked and punished.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Rousseauian:</span> Sees people as generally good but corrupted by society, emphasizing education and personal responsibility.</li>
        </ul>
