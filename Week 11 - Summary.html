        </ul>

        <h2>Main Topics</h2>

        <h3>Self-Interest vs. Moral Obligations</h3>
        <p>One of the central themes of this book is the dichotomy between self-interest and moral obligations. This chapter explores when self-interest should take precedence over the public interest and the complexities involved in such decisions. For instance, in cases of whistleblowing, individuals must weigh personal risks against moral imperatives to act ethically.</p>
        <p>Balancing self-interest with moral obligations can be challenging, especially when personal and professional stakes are high. This chapter encourages critical reflection on the reasons behind our actions and the importance of honesty with ourselves and others in making ethical decisions.</p>

        <h3>Limitations of Regulations</h3>
        <p>Regulations alone cannot ensure ethical behavior in business. While laws are necessary to address specific issues, they often come into effect only after damage has been done. Furthermore, creating and enforcing regulations is complex, requiring consensus on facts and values, and effective cooperation from industry experts.</p>
        <p>To promote ethical business practices, it is essential for corporations and individuals to uphold high moral standards and monitor their own behavior. This broad view of corporate social responsibility goes beyond mere legal compliance, emphasizing the need for proactive ethical conduct.</p>

        <h3>Ethical Leadership and Living an Ethical Life</h3>
        <p>Ethical leadership is crucial in setting the moral tone of an organization. Leaders who demonstrate integrity, transparency, and a commitment to ethical values can inspire and motivate employees, fostering a positive and ethical corporate culture.</p>
        <p>Living an ethical life involves making decisions that do not harm others and contribute to societal well-being. Research suggests that ethical behavior and acts of kindness can lead to greater personal happiness and fulfillment, aligning individual well-being with broader social good.</p>

        <h3>Case Study: Banking Royal Commission</h3>
        <div class="case-study">
            <h3>Case Study: Banking Royal Commission</h3>
            <p>The Banking Royal Commission in Australia revealed significant ethical lapses within the financial sector. Despite recommendations for reforms, implementation has been slow, highlighting the challenges in regulating corporate behavior effectively.</p>
            <p>This case underscores the importance of not only regulatory frameworks but also the need for ethical leadership and corporate accountability. Banks must adopt ethical practices and prioritize customer trust and social responsibility to regain legitimacy and public confidence.</p>

        <h2>Homework Questions and Detailed Answers</h2>

        <h3>1. Why is there no one-size-fits-all ethical theory?</h3>
        <p>There is no one-size-fits-all ethical theory because ethical dilemmas are complex and multifaceted, often involving conflicting values and interests. Different ethical theories offer various perspectives and solutions, each with its strengths and limitations. For instance, deontological ethics focuses on duties and rules, while consequentialist ethics considers the outcomes of actions. Virtue ethics emphasizes character and moral virtues. The diversity of ethical theories allows for a more comprehensive analysis of moral issues, accommodating different contexts and individual perspectives.</p>

        <h3>2. What is a supererogatory action?</h3>
        <p>A supererogatory action is one that goes beyond what is morally required or expected. These actions are considered "above and beyond the call of duty" and are performed out of altruism or a desire to do good, without any obligation. Examples include acts of heroism, such as risking one's life to save others, or significant charitable contributions. Supererogatory actions are praiseworthy and admirable, but not performing them does not result in moral blame or criticism.</p>

        <h2>Activities and Homework Solutions</h2>
        <p>Week 11 activities involve discussions and exercises that help students apply the concepts learned in the lecture. These activities include analyzing the ethical dimensions of self-interest and moral obligations, exploring the limitations of regulations, and developing strategies for ethical leadership.
