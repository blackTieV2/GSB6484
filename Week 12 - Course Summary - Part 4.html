        <ul>
            <li>Understand the principles of ethical leadership and the role of leaders in fostering an ethical culture within organizations.</li>
            <li>Analyze the importance of corporate governance and risk management in promoting ethical behavior.</li>

        <h2>Main Topics</h2>

        <h3>Ethical Leadership</h3>
        <p>Ethical leadership is essential for setting the moral tone of an organization. Leaders must demonstrate integrity, transparency, and a commitment to ethical values to inspire and influence their followers. Ethical leaders act proactively towards influencing ethical and unethical behavior within the organization.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-term">Leader Morality:</span> Ethical leaders prioritize ethics in decision-making and ensure their own behavior is morally sound.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Follower Morality:</span> Ethical leaders need ethical followers who support and uphold the organization's ethical standards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Corporate Governance and Risk Management</h3>
        <p>Corporate governance involves the systems and processes by which organizations are directed and controlled. Effective governance ensures accountability, transparency, and ethical behavior. Risk management is integral to corporate governance, as it involves identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks to minimize negative impacts on the organization and its stakeholders.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-term">Board of Directors:</span> The board is responsible for representing shareholder interests and directing management to achieve ethical and sustainable business practices.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Obligations of Directors:</span> Directors must exercise their powers with care, diligence, and in good faith, acting in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Institutionalizing Ethics</h3>
        <p>Institutionalizing ethics involves embedding ethical principles and standards into the organizational culture and practices. This can be achieved through the development and implementation of ethics programs, codes of conduct, and policies that promote ethical behavior and decision-making.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-term">Ethics Program:</span> A comprehensive ethics program includes a code of ethics, policies for investigating and disciplining unethical behavior, incentives for ethical behavior, ethics training, an ethics helpline, monitoring systems, and ethics audits.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Education, Training, and Commitment:</span> Continuous education and training are essential to keep the ethics program dynamic and relevant. Commitment from all levels of the organization is crucial for the successful implementation of ethical standards.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Auditing an Ethics System:</span> Regular audits are necessary to ensure the ethics system is functioning as intended. The audit must be evidence-based, rigorous, and conducted by independent auditors to avoid conflicts of interest.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Balancing Self-Interest and Moral Obligations</h3>
        <p>Balancing self-interest with moral obligations is a critical aspect of ethical decision-making. Professionals have a duty to act in the best interests of their stakeholders and society while considering their own self-interest. This balance is particularly relevant in situations involving conflicts of interest, whistleblowing, and corporate governance lapses.</p>

        <h2>Critical Theories and Frameworks</h2>
        <p>The study of ethical behavior within organizations involves various critical theories and frameworks that provide different perspectives on leadership, governance, and ethical practices. These include:</p>

        <h3>Kohlberg’s Stages of Moral Development</h3>
        <p>Kohlberg’s theory of moral development outlines three levels of moral reasoning: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional. Each level represents a different approach to ethical decision-making, ranging from obedience to rules to principled reasoning based on universal ethical principles.</p>

        <h3>Corporate Governance Frameworks</h3>
        <p>Various frameworks guide corporate governance practices, including the COSO Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, which provides a structured approach to managing risks. The COSO framework consists of five levels: governance and culture, strategy and objective-setting, performance, review and revision, and information, communication, and reporting.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-term">Governance & Culture:</span> Exercises board risk oversight, establishes operating structures, defines desired culture, demonstrates commitment to core values, and attracts, develops, and retains capable individuals.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Strategy & Objective-Setting:</span> Analyzes business context, defines risk appetite, evaluates alternative strategies, and formulates business objectives.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Performance:</span> Identifies risks, assesses severity of risks, prioritizes risks, implements risk responses, and develops portfolio view.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Review & Revision:</span> Assesses substantial change, reviews risk and performance, and pursues improvement in enterprise risk management.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Information, Communication, & Reporting:</span> Leverages information and technology, communicates risk information, and reports on risk, culture, and performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Normative Ethics</h3>
        <p>Normative ethics focuses on creating or stating rules of behavior that standardize, control, regulate, and prescribe ethical conduct. This approach sets values and norms that guide behavior, emphasizing what is morally right or wrong, good or bad, just or unjust.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-term">Justice and Fairness:</span> Ensuring fair treatment and equitable distribution of benefits and burdens.</li>
            <li><span class="important-term">Integrity and Honesty:</span> Upholding truthfulness and transparency in all business dealings.</li>
        </ul>
